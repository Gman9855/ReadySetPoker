# ReadySetPoker

An app for organizing home poker games.  Schedule and create new games, invite friends, RSVP to games you're invited to, and view completed games.

To use:  after logging in with Facebook, you will be presented with the games list, and you can filter upcoming or completed games.  Tapping a cell goes to the game detail view, where you can view details about the game, RSVP, see who's going, who's not going, or who has a pending invite.  You can tap the plus icon at the top right of the games list to create your own home game.  All games either you create or are invited to are saved, so you can view the games even if you don't have a connection.
